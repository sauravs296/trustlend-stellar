# Formal Verification for TrustLend Lending Protocol

## Why Formal Verification

Unit tests demonstrate the *absence* of bugs for specific inputs. A lending
protocol handling financial assets requires stronger guarantees: mathematical
proofs that core invariants hold for **all** inputs within defined ranges.

Formal verification was added to:
1. **Prove correctness** of interest calculations, fee formulas, and accounting logic.
2. **Detect edge cases** that manual test cases miss (integer overflow, negative debt, etc.).
3. **Provide CI-enforced guarantees** that regressions are caught immediately.

## Framework Selection

### Kani (Rust Model Checker) — Primary

**Why Kani:**
- Native Rust — no external DSL or K definitions required
- `#![no_std]` compatible — works with Soroban's constrained environment
- Enumerates all execution paths within bounded input ranges
- Produces concrete counterexamples on failure
- Integrates via `cargo kani` with minimal setup

**Alternatives considered:**
| Framework | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Certora | Solidity-only; incompatible with Rust/Soroban |
| K Framework | Requires writing K definitions from scratch; steep learning curve |
| Prusti | Limited support for Soroban macro-heavy code |
| MIRI | Detects undefined behavior only, not logical invariants |

### proptest (Property-Based Testing) — Complementary

**Why proptest:**
- Fuzz-tests mathematical functions with randomly generated inputs
- Stochastic exploration can discover edge cases missed by Kani's bounded enumeration
- Runs inside standard `cargo test` — no additional toolchain
- Excellent for arithmetic edge cases (overflow, division by zero, boundary values)

## Verified Invariants

### Accounting (10 invariants)

| ID | Invariant |
|---|---|
| INV-ACCT-1 | `remaining_due >= 0` after loan creation |
| INV-ACCT-2 | `remaining_due <= total_due` at creation |

| INV-MATH-8 | Platform fee does not exceed interest |
| INV-MATH-9 | Flash loan fee does not exceed amount |
| INV-MATH-10 | Rate switch fee calculation is correct |
| INV-MATH-11 | Interest for 1 day at minimum rate is the smallest positive interest |
| INV-MATH-12 | 365-day interest equals `principal * rate_bps / 10_000` |

## Known Limitations

### Soroban Host Functions Cannot Be Model-Checked

Kani operates at the Rust MIR level and cannot verify Soroban host functions
(`env.storage()`, `env.events()`, token transfers). Proofs focus on the
**computation and state transition logic** that can be expressed in pure Rust.

### Cross-Contract Behavior Is Outside Scope

The lending contract interacts with EscrowContract, GovernanceContract,
BorrowerReputationContract, and TreasuryContract. These cross-contract calls
cannot be verified in isolation. They require system-level verification tools
(not yet available for Soroban).

### Bounded Input Ranges

All proofs operate over bounded input ranges:
- Principal: 0 to 100,000 XLM (100_000_000_000 stroops)
- Rate: 1 to 1500 bps (0.01% to 15%)
- Duration: 1 to 365 days
- Fees: 0 to 1000 bps (platform), 0 to 500 bps (flash loan)

Values outside these ranges are not verified but represent the protocol's
operational bounds.

### Integer Division Truncation

The interest formula uses integer division (`/ (10_000 * 365)`), which loses
precision. Proofs verify the exact integer arithmetic, not ideal mathematical
equality. This means verified invariants hold for the *actual* contract behavior.

### proptest Is Stochastic

Property-based tests use randomised input generation. They explore the input
space statistically but cannot provide the same exhaustiveness guarantees as
Kani. Running more test iterations increases confidence.

## Running Verification

### Property-Based Tests (proptest)

```bash
cd contracts
cargo test -p lending --test proptest_tests -- --test-threads=1
```

### Kani Verification

Requires [Kani](https://model-checking.github.io/kani/) installed:

```bash
cd contracts/lending
kani kani_proofs/math.rs
kani kani_proofs/accounting.rs
kani kani_proofs/state_machine.rs
kani kani_proofs/flash_loan.rs
kani kani_proofs/fees.rs
```

### CI Integration

Verification runs automatically in CI via `.github/workflows/formal-verification.yml`:
- Triggers on PRs and pushes to main/dev that change `contracts/lending/**`
- Runs property-based tests
- Runs Kani model checking (when Kani is available in the CI environment)
- Failures block the merge pipeline
