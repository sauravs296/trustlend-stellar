/**
 * Referral qualification hook (Issue #266).
 *
 * When a borrower's loan reaches 100% funded and activates, their referrer's
 * bonus becomes payable. The authoritative payout happens on-chain — the
 * lending contract invokes ReferralRewardsContract::claim_referral_bonus during
 * activate_loan — so this module's job is only to mirror that into the database and
 * notify the referrer.
 *
 * Every failure here is swallowed and logged. A referral is a bonus; it must
 * never turn a successful loan funding into a failed API request.
