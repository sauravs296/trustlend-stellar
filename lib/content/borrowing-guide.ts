  "The check uses on-chain state and market prices, not the value your collateral had when you deposited it. Your position can cross the line while you are asleep.",
  "You are not warned by the protocol before it happens. The Health Factor gauge on your dashboard is the warning — check it, especially in volatile markets.",
  "Liquidation is triggered by the value of your collateral falling (or your debt growing with interest), not by missing a payment. A loan that is not yet due can still be liquidated.",
  "Falling behind on payments is handled separately: an overdue loan gets a grace period before default management steps in.",
];

export const liquidationThresholdRules: string[] = [
  `Everyone starts from a base threshold of ${BASE_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD_BPS / 100}% LTV.`,
  "Your trust score raises it — the protocol adds 1.5 basis points of headroom for every reputation point, so a strong borrower can sustain a higher LTV before being liquidated.",
  "Volatile collateral lowers it — half of the asset's volatility (in basis points) is subtracted, because a jumpy asset can fall through the buffer faster.",
  `The result is clamped to between ${MIN_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD_BPS / 100}% and ${MAX_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD_BPS / 100}% LTV, so no borrower is ever liquidated above or below those bounds.`,

  thresholdLabel: "Your liquidation threshold",
  thresholdValue: "75%",
  narrative:
    "You are safe at 70% LTV against a 75% threshold. But LTV is debt divided by collateral value — so if your collateral falls to $930 while your debt stays at $700, your LTV rises to ~75% and the keeper can liquidate you. You did not borrow any more; the collateral simply became worth less.",
  takeaway:
    "The smaller the gap between your LTV and your threshold, the smaller the price move needed to liquidate you. Borrowing well below your limit is the cheapest protection there is.",

  "Add collateral as soon as you enter the warning band, rather than waiting to see whether the price recovers.",
  "Make partial repayments. Cutting your debt lowers your LTV just as effectively as adding collateral.",

// ─── FAQ ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

export const borrowingFaq: FaqEntry[] = [
  {
    category: "Basics",
    question: "What does 'collateralized borrowing' actually mean?",
    answer:
      "You lock up an asset before you borrow. The protocol lets you borrow only a fraction of that asset's value, and holds the asset until you repay. If the value of your collateral falls too far relative to your debt, the protocol sells it to repay the lenders.",
  },
  {
    category: "Basics",
    question: "Do I need collateral if I have a good trust score?",
    answer:
      "Collateralized loans always require collateral. Your trust score does not remove that requirement — it raises the LTV you can safely run at and improves the rate lenders offer you.",
  },
  {
    category: "Basics",
    question: "How long does it take to get funded?",
    answer:
      "It depends on lenders. Your request is listed in the marketplace immediately, and lenders choose which loans to fund based on your trust score, the amount, the APR and the duration. A loan may be funded by several lenders in stages rather than all at once.",
  },
  {
    category: "Collateral & Risk",
    question: "How much can I borrow against my collateral?",
    answer: `By default, up to ${DEFAULT_COLLATERAL_FACTOR_BPS / 100}% of your collateral's value. Individual assets can be configured with a lower or higher collateral factor, so check the figure shown for the specific asset you are depositing.`,
  },
  {
    category: "Collateral & Risk",
    question: "What is a Health Factor and what number should I aim for?",
    answer: `Health Factor is your collateral value divided by your outstanding debt. Below 1.0 your position is under-collateralized and can be liquidated. Keep it above ${HF_SAFE_THRESHOLD} for a comfortable buffer; between ${HF_WARNING_THRESHOLD} and ${HF_SAFE_THRESHOLD} you are in the warning band and should act.`,
  },
  {
    category: "Collateral & Risk",
    question: "Can I be liquidated even if I have never missed a payment?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Liquidation is driven by the value of your collateral against your debt, not by your payment history. If the market price of your collateral falls far enough, your LTV crosses your threshold and the keeper liquidates the position — even on a loan that is not yet due.",
  },
  {
    category: "Collateral & Risk",
    question: "Will I be warned before I am liquidated?",
    answer:
      "The protocol does not send you a warning before liquidating. The Health Factor gauge on your dashboard is the warning signal, and it updates as prices move. Check it regularly, particularly if your collateral is a volatile asset.",
  },
  {
    category: "Collateral & Risk",
    question: "Can I add more collateral to an active loan?",
    answer:
      "Yes, and it is one of the two fastest ways to recover from the warning band. Adding collateral raises your Health Factor and lowers your LTV immediately. Repaying part of the debt has the same effect from the other direction.",
  },
  {
    category: "Collateral & Risk",
    question: "What happens to my collateral if I am liquidated?",
    answer:
      "The keeper marks the loan as Defaulted on-chain. Your collateral stays locked against that debt — you cannot withdraw it, because the contract only releases collateral while your borrowing power covers your active debt — and the position is settled to repay the lenders. A default also damages your trust score, which affects the terms you are offered afterwards.",
  },
  {
    category: "Repayment",
    question: "Can I repay early, or in instalments?",
    answer:
      "Both. Partial repayments are supported at any point during the loan — each one is recorded on-chain and reduces your remaining balance right away. Repaying the full balance early closes the loan and releases your collateral.",
  },
  {
    category: "Repayment",
    question: "What happens if I miss the due date?",
    answer: `Missing the due date is treated separately from liquidation. An overdue loan enters a grace period of ${DEFAULT_GRACE_PERIOD_DAYS} days by default before the default-management process acts on it, so a short delay is recoverable. A loan that goes to default damages your trust score.`,
  },
  {
    category: "Repayment",
    question: "When do I get my collateral back?",
    answer:
      "Once your remaining balance reaches zero the loan status becomes Repaid and that collateral is no longer locked against it. Withdrawing is a separate action you initiate — the contract permits it as long as your remaining borrowing power still covers any other active loans you hold.",
  },
  {
    category: "Costs & Rates",
    question: "Is the rate I see APR or APY?",
    answer:
      "APR. TrustLend loans accrue simple interest, so the rate you are quoted is not compounded. A 12% APR on 100 XLM borrowed for a full year costs 12 XLM in interest.",
  },
  {
    category: "Costs & Rates",
    question: "What is the difference between Fixed and Floating rates?",
    answer:
      "Fixed locks your rate when the loan is created, so your cost is predictable. Floating starts lower and moves with pool utilization — it rises as more of the pool is borrowed. Choose Fixed if you want certainty, Floating if you expect utilization to stay low.",
  },
  {
    category: "Costs & Rates",
    question: "Can I switch between Fixed and Floating after borrowing?",
    answer: `Yes. Switching charges a fee of ${RATE_SWITCH_FEE_BPS / 100}% of your remaining debt and there is a 24-hour cooldown between switches, so it is not something to do reactively on every rate move.`,
